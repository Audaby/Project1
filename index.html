            <h1>About Nelson Mandela</h1>
            <p>Nelson Mandela, born Rolihlahla in 1918, was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and the nation's first Black president, serving from 1994 to 1999. He spent 27 years in prison for his activism against the racist apartheid regime, eventually becoming a symbol of reconciliation and peace. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his role in ending apartheid. </p>
